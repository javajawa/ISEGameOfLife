				The ISE Game of Life tool is a project design to simulate the
				interactions of a number of Agents in a Hunter-Gather like society. The
				society is allowed to form groups, in which leadership characteristics
				and complex politics may emerge. The project comes with a series of
				pre-implemented agents and simulations Here, we shall briefly explain how to
				utilise the framework to your own ends.
			</p>

			<h2>Getting Started</h2>
			<p>
				Each Simulation represents a unique world. While these worlds will have similar starting points,
				most of the features are specified by you, the user, or are randomly generated. This includes everything from the
				initial state of each agent - name, beliefs, food - to fundamental properties of the environment,
				such as how much food each animal is worth.
			</p>
			<p>
				Within each simulation, there exists the Environment and Agents. The environment contains
				information about the world, such as animals that exist and how much food they provide when hunted, but also the
				status of each agent - alive or dead and in which group they are. The agents represent the hunters themselves, and contain methods to group together and assist each other in making hunting decisions.
			</p>
			<p>
				Agents perform actions upon the environment, such as hunting, attempting to join groups or dying which are dealt with
				via ActionHandlers in the environment. Similarly, the environment provides agents with inputs (dealt with by the agent
				via InputHandlers) and include events such as the result of a hunt and consuming food.
			</p>

			<h2>Creating your own Simulations</h2>
			<p>
				To create your own simulation, you add a new class to the Simulations package. This class must extend GenericSimulation
				and implement all of the abstract function, which convey:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>What plugins the simulation will use</li>
				<li>What food exists, how much nutrition they provide and how many hunters are required to succeed</li>
				<li>What kinds of agents exist</li>
				<li>What kinds of groups exist</li>
				<li>Events which can occur</li>
				<li>How Free Agents are handled</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				The functions used to specify these facts are found within GenericSimulation. Note that
				if you wish to include your own custom agents/groups/plugins they must be present as their
				own seperate class in the correct package. More details are given below.
			</p>

			<h2>Implementing Your Own Agents</h2>
			<p>
				The {@link ise.mace.participants.AbstractAgent AbstractAgent} class defines how an agent (ie Hunters)
				interact with the modelling system. As a result, all custom Agents
				should extend AbstractAgent. Each agent has a UUID that identifies it.
			</p>
			<p>
				The constructor requires two primary properties - the amount of food
				that the agent starts with and the amount consumed each turn.
				Note that the default constructor should not be used.
			</p>
			<p>
				The remainder of the class contains functions which allow an angent to
				perform various actions. These include:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Choosing what to hunt</li>
				<li>Asking others for advice about what to hunt</li>
				<li>Giving advice</li>
				<li>Choosing which group to join and applying to groups</li>
				<li>Making proposals and voting for group movement</li>
				<li>Updating loyalty/happiness/trust values</li>
				<li>Functions to put inputs in a queue and execute them</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				The AbstractGroupAgent class defines the behaviour of groups, and are
				themsleves modelled as agents (to make Presage happy). Each group has
				a UUID that idetifies it.
			</p>
			<p>
				Groups contain a list of all the members of the group, and respond to
				applications. In addition, they have fuctions which deal with the
				creation of new groups (onActivate()) and remove the group once it
				is empty or disbanded (onDeActivation()).
